# Welcome to HurleyHan888 Github Pages

##Introduction
This is a place for me to link some writing pieces so that you may see the types of work and projects that I have completed.  

As I begin my Freelance writing side-hustle this is the place that it shall all begin and become a marketing aid to help share skills and capabilities.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hurleyhan888/hurleyhan888.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hurleyhan888/hurleyhan888.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
